I am a British academic and economist of Nepali origin. I was born in Okhaldhunga and grew up in Jhapa, Nepal. I completed my first degree at Mechi Campus (1978) and my MA at Kirtipur Campus (1981), Tribhuvan University, Nepal. I joined Nepal Rastra Bank (the Central Bank of Nepal) in 1983 and worked as a research/deputy chief officer until 1988. I came to the UK for further studies and received my MPhil (1990) and a PhD (1993) in Economics from the University of Glasgow. I worked at Keele (1994) and Loughborough (1995) universities as a research associate/fellow. My academic career began as a lecturer at the University of Wales, Swansea in January 1996. I was appointed a professor of economics and finance at Brunel University in 2001, returning to Swansea University as a professor of finance in 2004 and then joined Cardiff Business School (CARBS) as a professor of economics in 2006, where I have been working ever since. I was the Head of economics between 2012 and 2015.
